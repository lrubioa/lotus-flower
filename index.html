        <p> The lotus flower is a plant native to Asia and Australia, with a very large range. The flower is a aquatic perinnial, 
            which means it grows in the water and is dormant in the winter, but can be seen throughout summer and autumn. It prefers to 
            grow in shallow water and warm sunlight. Flower colors include blue, white, pink, purple and red. Each flower lasts for a 
            few days at most, but many are produced. In many cultures and religions, the lotus flower represents purity, grace, beauty, 
            and persistence, with how beautiful and clean it's petals are, comparedto its swampy habitat. Lotus flowers have many

            145 million years. It even survived the Ice Age, which ended the existence of so many other plant and animal species.

            and rebloom once more.
